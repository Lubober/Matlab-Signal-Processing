The documentations for each matlab file are included in them.

Audio Processing:
The "Audio-Processing" folder contains the implementation of a Multiband Audio Equaliser which has a range of functionalities such as high/low pass filters, shelving filters and peak filters. 
Another functionality in the "Audio-Processing" folder is an audio delay algorithm which if tweaked right can give some very nice sounding audio delay effect.

Image Processing:
The "Image-Processing" folder contains a segmentation algorithm which takes an image and splits it into foreground and background binary mask. 
It also has an "extra" algorithm which uses different algorithms to change the appearance of an image extremely and create something new from existing images.
